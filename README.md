# Genesis Apex

Genesis Apex is a **PowerShell project** designed to automate common system maintenance and preparation tasks for Windows environments. It is intended for IT automation, device preparation, and routine maintenance, all from a single entry point.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Do not run the included scripts individually. Always launch WUH via the bootstrapper, which ensures correct setup and execution.

### ‚ú® Features

* **üíΩ Disk Utility:** Auto-detects and runs disk utility software like Samsung Magician or Kingston SSD Manager.
* **üõ†Ô∏è System Health:** Runs System File Checker (SFC) to ensure system integrity.
* **‚ö° Performance:** Temporarily sets the power plan to "Maximum Performance" and restores it after the run is complete.
* **üì¶ Software Management:** Sets up NuGet and PSGallery with trust handling, and handles software installation and cleanup via Chocolatey and Winget.
* **üåê UniFi Server Management:** Installs or upgrades the UniFi Network Server and its Java dependency.
* **üìù Ephemeral Logging:** Creates detailed, task-specific log files during execution inside a temporary folder (`%TEMP%\WUH\src\Log`). **Note:** This folder is automatically deleted by the bootstrapper upon script completion.

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

The `bootstrapper.ps1` script is the main entry point. It downloads the latest `WUH.ps1` and other required scripts from GitHub. It also ensures that dependencies are configured and then starts the maintenance workflow you select.

### Typical Workflow

When you launch the bootstrapper, you'll be prompted to select a mode and a task.

**Mode Selection:**
* **Silent Mode:** All logs are saved to a file without displaying console output.
* **Verbose Mode:** Logs are shown in the console and are also saved to a file.

**Task Selection:**
* **Machine Preparation (semi-automated):** This option downloads and runs vendor driver tools, installs baseline IT software via Chocolatey/Winget, and then runs all the maintenance tasks, including Windows Update, Winget cleanup, Office updates, and System File Checker.
* **Windows Maintenance:** This option runs the core maintenance tasks, including Windows Update, Winget cleanup, Office updates, and System File Checker.
* **Install/Upgrade UniFi Server:** A dedicated task to download, install, or upgrade the UniFi Network Server, including its Java dependency and firewall rules.
