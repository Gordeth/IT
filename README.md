# Windows Update Helper (WUH)

Windows Update Helper (WUH)This PowerShell project automates common system maintenance and preparation tasks for Windows environments.
It is designed for IT automation, device preparation, and routine maintenance with one single entry point.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Do not run the included scripts individually. Always launch via the bootstrapper, which ensures correct setup and execution.
‚ú® Features
üíΩ Disk utility auto-detection (Samsung Magician, Kingston SSD Manager, etc.)
üõ†Ô∏è System File Checker (SFC) with CBS.log analysis
üîÑ Temporary max-performance power plan (restored after run)
‚òÅÔ∏è NuGet + PSGallery setup with trust handling
üì¶ Chocolatey / Winget software installation & cleanup
üìù Detailed logging (stored in %TEMP%\ITScripts\Log\WUH.txt)

üìÇ Project Structure
File	Purpose
bootstrapper.ps1	Main entry point. Downloads and runs the latest WUH.ps1.
WUH.ps1	Core maintenance script orchestrating all tasks.
Functions.ps1	Shared helper functions (logging, script execution, Office detection).
MACHINEPREP.ps1	Machine preparation tasks (driver tools, baseline IT setup).
WGET.ps1	Winget update/cleanup routine.
MSO_UPDATE.ps1	Optional Microsoft Office update routine.

The bootstrapper:

Downloads the latest WUH.ps1 and required helper scripts from GitHub.
Ensures dependencies (NuGet, PSGallery trust, etc.) are configured.
Starts the maintenance workflow (Machine Preparation or Windows Maintenance).
You always run the bootstrapper, never the other scripts directly.
üñ•Ô∏è Typical Workflow
When you launch the bootstrapper, the following happens:
Mode Selection
Silent Mode ‚Üí Logs everything, no console noise.
Verbose Mode ‚Üí Shows logs in console and saves to file.
